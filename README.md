**MENTOR NAME** :

In this task, the goal was to develop a responsive webpage that fetches and displays data from a public API. For this, the webpage dynamically loads real-time data such as weather information or news articles using an API. The programming languages used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was used to create the basic structure of the webpage, while CSS was employed for styling and making the page responsive across different devices. JavaScript played a critical role in fetching data from the API and displaying it on the page. Specifically, JavaScript's Fetch API was used to make HTTP requests to retrieve the data. This data was then processed and displayed in a structured format on the webpage, allowing the user to view updated information such as weather forecasts or the latest news. Additionally, JavaScript was used to dynamically update the webpage, making it interactive and user-friendly. The use of Bootstrap or custom media queries in CSS helped ensure the webpage was responsive and functional across multiple screen sizes.
